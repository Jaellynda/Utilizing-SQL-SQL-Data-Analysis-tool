  
# Introduction
This script was created to introduce the essential principles of data analysis through SQL, a vital instrument for every data scientist. SQL functions not only as a tool for data access but also as a flexible means for performing sophisticated data analysis.

The foundational logic of SQL is closely in sync with that of other tools and languages used in data analysis, such as Excel and Pandas. Those familiar with working with data should find SQL's structure and capabilities to be intuitive and readily adaptable.

# Important Definitions
SQL is a conceptual language crafted for the management and interaction with data stored in databases, with our specific utilization being the SQLite implementation. It's noteworthy that the capabilities outlined in this document are shared by most SQL languages. Differences among them typically revolve around factors such as performance, advanced analytical features, and, of course, pricing considerations.
 
In the realm of data analysis, we will employ SQL to formulate queries for extracting data from the database, executing various manipulations, sorting the data, and gleaning meaningful insights from it.

The foundation of any database lies in its tables, acting as repositories for all the data. Generally, data is structured into multiple tables rather than being stored in a single location, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful data structure design. This script primarily centers on the techniques for working with these tables.

It's crucial to acknowledge that there exist additional valuable concepts and features beyond the scope of this script. These include table creation, the insertion or updating of data in the database, and the utilization of functions. Functions, taking a value as input and returning a modified version of that value, can be exceptionally beneficial, such as functions designed to remove white spaces or apply other transformations.
