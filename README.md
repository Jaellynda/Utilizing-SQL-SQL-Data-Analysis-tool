  
# Introduction
This script was developed with the aim of introducing the fundamental concepts of data analysis using SQL, a crucial tool for every data scientist. SQL serves as not only a means to access data but also a versatile tool for conducting advanced data analysis.

The underlying logic of SQL closely aligns with that of other data analysis tools and languages, such as Excel and Pandas. For individuals accustomed to working with data, SQL's structure and functionality should feel intuitive and easily adaptable.

# Important Definitions
SQL is a conceptual language crafted for the management and interaction with data stored in databases, with our specific utilization being the SQLite implementation. It's noteworthy that the capabilities outlined in this document are shared by most SQL languages. Differences among them typically revolve around factors such as performance, advanced analytical features, and, of course, pricing considerations.

In the realm of data analysis, we will employ SQL to formulate queries for extracting data from the database, executing various manipulations, sorting the data, and gleaning meaningful insights from it.

The foundation of any database lies in its tables, acting as repositories for all the data. Generally, data is structured into multiple tables rather than being stored in a single location, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful data structure design. This script primarily centers on the techniques for working with these tables.

It's crucial to acknowledge that there exist additional valuable concepts and features beyond the scope of this script. These include table creation, the insertion or updating of data in the database, and the utilization of functions. Functions, taking a value as input and returning a modified version of that value, can be exceptionally beneficial, such as functions designed to remove white spaces or apply other transformations.
