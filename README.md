This script was developed with the aim of introducing the fundamental concepts of data analysis using SQL, a crucial tool for every data scientist. SQL serves as not only a means to access data but also a versatile tool for conducting advanced data analysis.

The underlying logic of SQL closely aligns with that of other data analysis tools and languages, such as Excel and Pandas. For individuals accustomed to working with data, SQL's structure and functionality should feel intuitive and easily adaptable.

# Important Definitions
SQL is a conceptual language designed for managing and interacting with data stored in databases, and in our case, we're using the specific implementation of SQLite. It's worth noting that most SQL languages share the capabilities outlined in this document. Differences between them often revolve around performance, advanced analytical features, and, of course, pricing considerations.

In the context of data analysis, we will leverage SQL to construct queries that extract data from the database, perform various manipulations, sort the data, and extract meaningful insights from it.

The cornerstone of any database is its tables, as they are the repositories where all the data resides. Typically, data is organized into multiple tables rather than being stored in a single location, making proper data structure design a critical consideration. This script primarily focuses on how to work with these tables.

It's important to note that there are other valuable concepts and features beyond the scope of this script, including table creation, inserting or updating data in the database, and the use of functions. Functions take a value as input and return a modified version of that value, which can be immensely useful, such as functions that remove white spaces or apply other transformations.
